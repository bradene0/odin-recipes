# odin-recipes
First project with The Odin Project
This is a project that will demonstrate my skills as a HTML developer, and later a CSS developer and so forth. I will showcase my git skills as well by attempting to follow the conventional commits git template. This will be a simple brutalist recipe website made exclusively with HTMl and possibly later revisited and made "prettier" with CSS.
