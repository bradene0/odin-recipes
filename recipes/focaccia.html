    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an easy to follow <strong>focaccia</strong> recipe that I have been making since I first started making bread,
    It has taken me far and doesn't use nearly as much olive oil as competing recipes. Because of this it does not need as long of
a bake time. This focaccia recipe is one of the few I've tried that do not result in an overly soggy/not crisp loaf. </p>

<p>I only wish I was as good a baker to have come up with this recipe myself. This is a King Arthur Baking Recipe. King Arthur baking 
    is the only website I use to source my recipes, as they have an invaluable resource for new bakers; The Help Line.  King Arthur Baking
    has a help line that you can call <em>anytime</em> with any question about a recipe they have on their site.
